<h1>
  Check out my Egg Timer Application!
</h1>

<p>
  I designed all the images and built a fully functional timer using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The inspiration for this project came from a video my friend shared of another creator developing a similar application. Wanting to add my own twist, I designed custom components and brought my own creative vision to life. This fun project not only challenged my coding skills but also let me express my love for cooking.
